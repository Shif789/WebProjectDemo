# WebProjectDemo
Converted a PSD file to Dynamic Website without backend functionalities using html5, css3, javascript, and jquery libraries to give animations.
Would be ideal to open the project in a code editor like VSCode and use the live server to view the website.
Also can double-click the index.html file to view the website.
Must have an internet connection.
